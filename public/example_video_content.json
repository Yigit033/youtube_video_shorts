  "script": "[1] On a cold morning in June 1815, Napoleon stood with victory within reach, yet the cannons stayed silent while minutes drained away like blood.\n\n[2] At Waterloo, the French army still held numerical strength, elite commanders, and momentum forged through years of continental war.\n\n[3] But rain-soaked ground delayed artillery, forcing Napoleon to hesitate, allowing Wellington time and Prussian reinforcements to move unseen.\n\n[4] What happens when an emperor built on speed pauses, and history gives his enemies exactly the time they need?\n\n[5] That single delay shattered an empire, proving some defeats are decided not by battle, but by one moment of waiting.",
